Block scope : variables declared inside a pair of curly braces cannot be acessed from outside the block.

Function scope : variables declared inside  a function cannot be acessed from outside the function.

Global scope : globally scoped variables can be acessed insidea block or function.

closure : A closure is the combination of a function bundled together with references to its surrounding state.
          Closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

Algorith Analysys
-------------------
it calculated based on Time Complexity and Space Complexity

*  Big-O Notation- Worst case complexity
*  Omega Notation - Best case complexity
*  Theta Notation - Average case Complexity


Big-O Notation- The worst case complexity of an algorithm is represented using the Big-O notation.
Big-O notation descripes the complexity of an algorithm using algebric terms.
